# OO_Project
This is our Object Oriented project.
In this project we used scans that were captured from WigleWIFI app on Android and merge them to one CSV file.
There is also an option to filter the file by time range, modle of the phone or location.

*In docs folder you can find the OOP_Project file which contains all the information you need in order to run our project.

**Csv2Kml function : 
In this class we create a KML file of WifiNetworks. We used in apiForKml jar files of micromata.
for the code we helped in this example code and changed it to fit our project : https://github.com/micromata/javaapiforkml/blob/master/src/test/java/de/micromata/jak/examples/Example1.java

Hope you'll find our project successful.
Bar, Noy and Doriya.
